# Stock-Selection-Algorithm
Utilizing the daily movements of the NASDAQ-100 Index we developed a stock selection algorithm that can choose a specified number of stocks that best represents the NASDAQ Index without having to buy all 100 stocks. For example we can select the optimal 5 or 10 stocks out of the 100 stocks in the NASDAQ index that will result in the minimum difference between our selected stock returns and the NASDAQ-100 returns.
